title: August 2014 Everyday Carry
---

Everyday carry, as of August 2014.

{% include image.html image="EDC_2014-08.jpg" caption="August 2014 everyday carry" %}

Pictured, from top left to bottom right...

Wad of cash folded over my debit card, held together with a couple hair elastics.  ["See, keep the big bills on the outside"][kramer].

A small [L.L. Bean pocket knife][knife] with leather sheath.

J. Crew Factory [leather card holder][wallet]. I keep my credit cards, license, etc. in here.

House key, with a cover made by [Cicada Leather Company][key-cover] and garage key on a leather fob keychain.

[Car][fr-s] key.  I prefer carrying this to the one that has the integrated remote, because it's less bulky.

Mirado [Black Warrior][pencil] pencil.

My grandfather's old watch.  It was in pretty rough shape when I first got it.  I cleaned it up, and replaced the band with a leather NATO strap from [cheapestnatostraps.com][straps]. I rotate this watch with either a [Citizen Skyhawk][skyhawk], or a [Timex military watch][timex].  I just noticed that the link to the Timex watch has "womens" in the URL -- I swear that it's a men's watch!

Work badge, key to filing cabinet, and RSA token.  The carabiner was a gift from my girlfriend -- I've had it for almost ten years; it's the oldest thing that I EDC.

[Zeiss Lens Cleaning wipes][wipes] to clean my glasses or my computer screen at work.

[Blistex lip balm][blistex].

A pack of [Big Red][gum] gum.

Not pictured: iPhone 5s, in a [brown leather case][case].  I've only had the case for a few weeks, I'm hoping that it the patina will make it look a little darker so that it matches the rest of my EDC items.
